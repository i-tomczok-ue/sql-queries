# sql-queries
Here are some SQL queries/exercises I practiced. 

I am using **SQL Management Studio 20** while working on the **AdventureWorks2019** database.
.bak file for database is available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms

*Tools: MS SQL*
